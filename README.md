This repository demonstrates an advanced solution for optimizing performance in Unity-based game projects. The implementation focuses on leveraging modern techniques to improve rendering, spatial data management, and pathfinding performance.

Key Features

1. GPU Instancing for Efficient Rendering

Utilizes GPU instancing to render multiple instances of the same mesh and material efficiently. This reduces draw calls and improves rendering performance for large-scale scenes.

2. Bitwise Archetype Check for Fast Filtering

Implements a bitwise system to categorize and filter entities based on their archetypes. This approach ensures high performance when querying and iterating over entities.

3. Iterative Quadtree Integration

A custom quadtree system is integrated to handle spatial partitioning. This enables efficient:

Insertion: Adds objects dynamically to the quadtree.

Search: Finds nearby objects quickly.

Subdivision: Optimizes partitioning as needed, ensuring balanced spatial data management.

4. Multithreaded Iterative A Pathfinding*

Features an A* pathfinding implementation designed for multithreaded execution. The system:

Processes pathfinding requests concurrently across multiple threads.

Utilizes iterative algorithms to maintain performance consistency.

Integrates seamlessly with the quadtree for spatial queries and obstacle management.
